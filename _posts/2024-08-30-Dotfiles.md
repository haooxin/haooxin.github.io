# Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed and enabled in your terminal (for example, try the [AnonymicePro Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)).

## Step 1: Install ZSH
Ensure that ZSH is installed on your system.

### For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh
```

### For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install zsh
```

## Step 2: Set ZSH as Default Shell
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
You may need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

## Step 3: Install Oh My Zsh
Install Oh My Zsh using curl:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Step 4: Install Starship
Download and install Starship:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh)" --yes
```

## Step 5: Install zsh-autosuggestions Plugin
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

## Step 6: Install zsh-syntax-highlighting Plugin
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

## Step 7: Install EZA
[EZA - A modern, maintained replacement for ls](https://eza.rocks/)

### Debian and Ubuntu
First make sure you have the `gpg` command, and otherwise install it via:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gpg
```

Then install eza via:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eza-community/eza/main/deb.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/gierens.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/gierens.gpg] http://deb.gierens.de stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gierens.list
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/keyrings/gierens.gpg /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gierens.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y eza
```

### Fedora
Fedora support is in the works.

## Step 8.1: Configure .zshrc File
Open the configuration file `.zshrc` in an editor:
```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add configuration for Starship:
```bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

Add plugins to the list in the `.zshrc` file:
```bash
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

Ensure that the initialization of `zsh-syntax-highlighting` plugin is at the end of the `.zshrc` file:
```bash
source ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

## Step 8.2: Fetch and Apply Dotfiles from My GitHub
Clone my dotfiles repository from GitHub to the /tmp directory and apply the settings:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haooxin/.dotfiles.git /tmp/dotfiles
```
Move all .dotfiles to your home directory.

## Step 9: Reload Configuration
Apply the changes by reloading the configuration file:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Step 10: Verification
Check if all components are working properly:
- Open the terminal and see if Starship is displaying its prompt.
- Start typing commands to see suggestions from `zsh-autosuggestions`.
- Check if the syntax is highlighted by `zsh-syntax-highlighting`.
